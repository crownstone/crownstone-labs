# Connected products

Crownstone Labs is committed to make non-connected devices part of the Internet-of-Things (**IoT**) world by making them connected. If you are developing a new product for consumers or businesses alike, and you want to make it part of a vast **ecosystem** where it can communicate with other products, to the internet or to the cloud, we can help with that! At Crownstone Labs we have experience with wireless and wired technologies, ranging from Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth Mesh, **Matter**, Zigbee, ZWave, and wired protocols. At Crownstone Labs we don't just hand over a printed circuit board (PCB) or firmware, we can make sure the device is connected over its entire lifetime, which includes serves such as **firmware updates** (DFU FOTA), **cloud** support, deployment apps.
