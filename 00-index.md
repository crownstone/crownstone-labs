# Connected products

Crownstone Labs is committed to making non-connected devices part of the Internet-of-Things (**IoT**) world by making them connected. If you are developing a new product for consumers or businesses alike, and you want to make it part of a vast **ecosystem** where it can communicate with other products, to the internet or the cloud, we can help with that! At Crownstone Labs we have experience with wireless and wired technologies, ranging from Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth Mesh, **Matter**, Zigbee, ZWave, and wired protocols. At Crownstone Labs we don't just hand over a printed circuit board (PCB) or firmware, we can make sure the device is connected over its entire lifetime, which includes services such as **firmware updates** (DFU FOTA), **cloud** support, deployment apps, and more.

# Embedded programming

Crownstone Labs has in-depth knowledge of **embedded programming** on a diverse set of microcontrollers, from bare-metal programming, real-time operating systems, encrypted bootloaders, radio stacks, to pattern recognition. Our experts can develop the **firmware** for your device, specially when your problems are truly tough or severely resource-constrained (regarding flash, ram, etc). We have experience with devices that have long lifetimes in the field and emphasize code quality, upgradeability, reliability, stability, safety, and security.
