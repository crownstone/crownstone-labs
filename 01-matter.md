# Matter starts a new smart home era

The current smart home solutions do not work well together, keeping the overall market small. This however changed in 2022: The Matter standard makes millions of smart home products work together. This means that there is a small time window to conquer the market for a device category. A smart home product must be Matter-compatible **before the holiday season of 2023** to be competitive in the market. No time to lose! The time to build is now!

# Matter brings together many of the biggest smart home players

Matter is the new smart home standard and driven by all major players. **Amazon** will push the update in 2022 to all 17 Echo devices. All new **Google** Nest and Home products have it built-in. **Apple** HomePod, Apple TV, watchOS, iPadOS are all Matter-certified. **Samsung** hubs are Matter controllers. Smart home products must be Matter-compatible by the end of 2023 to continue competing in the market.

**Crownstone's firmware experts** make your devices **Matter-compatible**.

Our expertise

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/global-container-begin %}


{% include snippets/column-frame-begin img='/images/matter/protocols.png' img-alt='protocols' title="Wireless protocols"%}

Matter builds on top of protocols such as Thread, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth LE, all of which we know the ins and outs.

{% include snippets/column-frame-end %}


{% include snippets/column-frame-begin img='/images/matter/embedded.png' img-alt='embedded' title="Embedded development"%}

To build Matter-based products fast, expertise in Matter-supporting RTOS (e.g. Zephyr), firmware updates over the air, mesh network expertise, etc. is all paramount to a robust product line for years to come.

{% include snippets/column-frame-begin img='/images/matter/security.png' img-alt='security' title="Security"%}

Matter comes with encryption in place, but to adhere to the future Cyber Resilience Act it's important to have in-depth knowledge on potential vulnerabilities.

{% include snippets/column-frame-end %}


{% include snippets/column-frame-begin img='/images/matter/nrf52840.png' img-alt='microcontrollers' title="Microcontrollers"%}

Matter requires embedded expertise of chipsets such as the Nordic nRF52840, the SiLabs EFR32MG21/24 series, the Espressif ESP32 series, all within our portfolio of microcontrollers we've worked with.
