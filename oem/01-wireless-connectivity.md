# Our favourite chipsets are by Nordic

We preferably use the **nRF52** series for a rapid ready-for-manufacturing (RFM) process. The nRF53 series supports Bluetooth 5.1 Direction Finding, Bluetooth 5 Long Range, NFC, Bluetooth Mesh, Thread, Zigbee and the nRF9160 supports NB-IoT/LTE-M (using an eSIM). Although, we've experienced excellent support by Nordic engineers, we're not limited to their chipsets.
