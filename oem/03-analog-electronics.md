Miniaturized power supplies

Power supplies are designed to supply a range of precisely defined voltages and currents towards the on-board circuitry. This is under a variety of conditions. For example, we have a (switched mode) topology that allows a **wide range** of input frequencies (from AC in Europe and the US towards DC) and is still very efficient. 

Our designs are robust with respect to a range of other conditions, be it thermal runaway, over-voltages, transient spikes, and all in an extremely **miniaturized form factor** and properly certified.

High-frequency power measurements

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin background="blue" %}

At Crownstone Labs we don't only measure power on a level of seconds, but we've designed circuitry that allows us to **measure voltage and current at high frequencies**. Frequencies orders of magnitude higher than the grid frequency. This allows for accurately measuring phase shifts, zero-crossings, and other characteristics of power signals. These can be used as building blocks for phase-cut dimming, safety features, anomaly detection, or even appliance recognition.

High-power switching and dimming

{% include snippets/slogan-end %}


{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin  text-alignment='right' %}

Crownstone Labs can provide high-power switching and dimming solutions. There are several power switch topologies available. For instance, we've used very extensively in the field, a bistable relay from Panasonic with a relay driver, a **NUD3112**, to be precise. 

Regarding dimming, Crownstone has expertise in designing gate driver solutions with a variety of **IGBTs** and **MOSFETs** and a variety of measures (different ways of clamping, etc.) to protect those components.

{% include snippets/full-width-container-begin background="blue"%}

{% include snippets/two-cols-text-img-begin background="blue" %}

At Crownstone Labs we have experience with different types of **antennas** such as ceramic, PCB, and metal (ProANT) as well as with different processors. We exploit the hardware capabilities of **wireless solutions** in-depth, be it low-power communication, directional information for localization, or optimization for mesh functionality.
