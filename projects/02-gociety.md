Collaboration with Gociety

Crownstone and Gociety are collaborating! You’d be surprised how much you can do with Bluetooth. 


Crownstone Labs is responsible for the development of a new compound sensor system for the detection of **unusual behavior** in households of people suffering from **dementia**.


In a Bluetooth mesh, each device receives messages from all others and can determine a Received Signal Strength Indication. Kind of like a mini-radar in your house. This RSSI value drops a little bit when a person walks in between a pair of devices, leading to what we call **Beaconless Tripwire Detection**. This innovation wouldn't have been possible without the necessary in-house knowledge of artificial intelligence.


Developing your own IoT products? Crownstone Labs can help accelerate development and reduce your time-to-market. Let’s make things smart together!
