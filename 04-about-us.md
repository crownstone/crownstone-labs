# A smarter device is a better device

Sustainability, comfort, efficiency, without sensing what's wrong with the current situation, our systems are blind. Crownstone Labs contributes state-of-the-art technology across the board. Efficient power supplies, wireless battery-free solutions, sophisticated integrations, machine learning on the edge, these are technologies we love to put our forces behind.
